# alfred-play-musicbox-workflow
 
 A simple way to add media to Marcos Tanaka’s wonderful apps [Play](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1596506190) and [MusicBox](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1614730313).

Uses the URL schemes (documented [here](https://marcosatanaka.com/support/play/play-help.html#url-schemes) and [here](https://marcosatanaka.com/support/musicbox/musicbox-help.html#url-schemes) respectively) to add the URL you paste after. If you have a specific link to enter as an argument, it will use that link, otherwise it will default to the clipboard. Should be able to pass multiple items if there are multiple items on the clipboard. If you don’t like the keywords I chose, please choose your own.
